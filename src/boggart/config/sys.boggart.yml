#
# This system-level configuration file is responsible for providing Boggart with
# its default set of supported languages and mutation operators. Please do not
# modify it! To add support for new languages and mutation operators to your
# local installation, you should provide a user-level configuration file.
#
# By default, Boggart looks for user-level configuration files at the path given
# by the environmental variable `BOGGART_USER_CONFIG_PATH`. If
# `BOGGART_USER_CONFIG_PATH` is undefined, `${HOME}/.boggart.yml` will be used
# instead.
